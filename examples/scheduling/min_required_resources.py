"""
Requirement: Find the number of workers needed to schedule per shift in a production plant for the next 2 days with the
    following conditions:
    * There is a number of required persons per hour and day given in the matrix "required_resources"
    * There are 4 available scheduling called "Morning", "Afternoon", "Night", "Mixed"; their start and end hour is
      determined in the dictionary "shifts_coverage", 1 meaning the shift is active at that hour, 0 otherwise
    * The number of required workers per day and period (hour) is determined in the matrix "required_resources"
    * The maximum number of workers that can be shifted simultaneously at any hour is 25, due plat capacity restrictions
    * The maximum number of workers that can be shifted in a same shift, is 20
